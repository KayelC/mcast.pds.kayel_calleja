**Note on Commit History**

*While the commit history may appear clustered near the end of the semester,
I worked on the worksheets consistently offline as preparation for the final exam.
Unfortunately, I did not push my progress regularly,
which I acknowledge was an important part of the coursework.
All work uploaded reflects genuine effort and understanding of the material.*
